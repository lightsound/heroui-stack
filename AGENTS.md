# Using Vite+ (`vp`)

**Vite+** is one CLI for dev, build, tests, lint, format, and package management—it wraps Vite and related bundled tooling. `vp dev` and `vp build` invoke Vite. Explore with `vp help`, `vp <command> --help`, and `vp --version`.

**Common commands:** `vp install`, `vp dev`, `vp check`, `vp lint`, `vp test`, `vp build`, `vp run <script>`, `vp add` / `vp remove` / `vp update`.

**Workflow:** After pulling, run `vp install` when dependencies or lockfiles may have changed. Before calling work done, run `vp check` and `vp test`.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Using the package manager directly:** Do not use pnpm, npm, or Yarn directly. Vite+ can handle all package manager operations.
- **Always use Vite commands to run tools:** Don't attempt to run `vp vitest` or `vp oxlint`. They do not exist. Use `vp test` and `vp lint` instead.
- **Running scripts:** Vite+ commands take precedence over `package.json` scripts. If there is a `test` script defined in `scripts` that conflicts with the built-in `vp test` command, run it using `vp run test`.
- **Do not install Vitest, Oxlint, Oxfmt, or tsdown directly:** Vite+ wraps these tools. They must not be installed directly. You cannot upgrade these tools by installing their latest versions. Always use Vite+ commands.
- **Use Vite+ wrappers for one-off binaries:** Use `vp dlx` instead of package-manager-specific `dlx`/`npx` commands.
- **Import JavaScript modules from `vite-plus`:** Instead of importing from `vite` or `vitest`, all modules should be imported from the project's `vite-plus` dependency. For example, `import { defineConfig } from 'vite-plus';` or `import { expect, test, vi } from 'vite-plus/test';`. You must not install `vitest` to import test utilities.
- **Type-Aware Linting:** There is no need to install `oxlint-tsgolint`, `vp lint --type-aware` works out of the box.

## Supplementary project tools

Not part of `vp check`. Use `vp run` so installs stay routed through Vite+.

- **Knip** (`vp run knip`) — unused files, dependencies, and exports. Use when trimming deps or refactoring entry points (`knip.config.ts` configures the project).
- **react-doctor** (`vp run doctor`) — React-focused health checks. The script uses `--no-lint`; keep ordinary linting on `vp lint`.

# Shared conventions

Portable conventions for AI coding agents. Everything here holds in any clone of any repository, including a fresh checkout on a cloud VM; nothing depends on one machine's paths or tools. Where a project-specific section of the file that carries this text says otherwise, the project-specific section takes precedence.

## Language

- English everywhere in the repository: code, comments, identifiers, commit messages, branch names, Issues, PR titles and bodies, and review comments.
- Exception: translation and i18n files and user-facing UI copy follow the product's language.

## Instruction files

- `AGENTS.md` carries the content; `CLAUDE.md` contains exactly `@AGENTS.md`. Do not put content in `CLAUDE.md` and do not write a prose pointer ("see AGENTS.md"): Claude Code only loads the `@` import form.
- Tool-scoped rules (glob-activated) go in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` or `.claude/rules/*.md`, not in the root pair.
- When an instruction file names a command or path, it must exist in the repository at the time of writing. Remove or update the reference when the target is renamed or deleted.
- Agent-facing instructions live in `AGENTS.md`. `README.md` is for humans; never duplicate `AGENTS.md` content into it.
